In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . <br/> Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . <br/> So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .
