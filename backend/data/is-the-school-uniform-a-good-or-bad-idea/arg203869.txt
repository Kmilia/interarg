I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. <br/> But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.
