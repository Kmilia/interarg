If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. <br/> Maybe I'm exaggerating. <br/> But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
