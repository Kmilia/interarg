I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in a limit, because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. <br/> Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened and watched.
