I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. <br/> I am not completely against TV but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people <br/> http://www.echoworld.com/B05/B0510/B0510TVBad.htm
