Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain..?
